The Apers Tree
==============

The Apers Tree displays the Academic Genealogy of prof.
Peter Apers. The tree is inspired by the wonderful
[Mathematics Genealogy Project][1] and a gift from the
Database Group of the University Twente on the occasion
of Peter's retirement on 16 February 2018.

To compile the tree, install [Graphviz][2] and run:

     dot aperstree.dot -Tpdf -oaperstree.pdf

The title and dedication was added with [Xournal][3].
